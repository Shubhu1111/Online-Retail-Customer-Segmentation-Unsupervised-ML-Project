## Project Summary
This project, titled "Online Retail Customer Segmentation," focuses on a UK-based non-store online retail venture specializing in distinctive gifts for all occasions. The objective is to identify the primary customer segments of the enterprise by analyzing a dataset of transactional information. This dataset includes details such as invoice numbers, product codes, descriptions, quantities, invoice dates, unit prices, customer IDs, and countries. The main goal is to uncover diverse customer segments based on their purchasing patterns and attributes, which may include demographics, buying frequency, and average expenditure. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to refining the company's marketing and sales strategies, enabling better customer engagement and driving revenue growth.

## Project Steps

### Important Libraries
In this project, several libraries have been utilized, including:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly

### Data Wrangling
Cleaning the Data: Cleaning the data is a crucial initial step before conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This involves:

- Removing duplicate rows.
- Handling missing values.
- Converting columns to appropriate datatypes.
- Adding relevant columns.

### RFM Analysis
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique that segments customers based on their recency of purchases, frequency of purchases, and monetary value of transactions.

### Machine Learning Models and Techniques
Various clustering techniques were applied to the dataset, including:

- K-Means clustering with Silhouette score.
- K-Means clustering with Elbow Method.
- Hierarchical clustering.
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise).

## Conclusion
The project implemented different clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and attributes, particularly focusing on the RFM analysis with 2 clusters.

This analysis offers valuable insights into the customer base of the online retail venture, aiding in the development of effective marketing strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction, ultimately leading to increased revenue.
